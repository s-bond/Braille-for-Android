Braille-for-Android
===================
**This is my first Android Project, and I have given my try to create a simple Braille application.**
> NOTE: The app would work correctly only on 10.1" tablet as it involves eight finger touch 
## Dirctions for using the App ##
 
- First, Select the language by drawing **semi circular arc** in clockwise direction at bottom of the screen
- Now place your eight fingers, leaving both thumbs in an approximate linear fashion on the screen
- Thats It, type using Braille combinations, leftmost finger is for space and righmost is for backspace.
- Draw a **S** at bottom to save the typed text, enter file name and draw **S** again.
- Saved files can be viewed by drawing a **small line** ( in eigher direction ) at the bottom of the screen.
- To go to the writing interface, simply shake the device.
